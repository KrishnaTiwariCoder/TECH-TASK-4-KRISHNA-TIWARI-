deployed link - https://google-docs-deploy.onrender.com/

As the name suggest, this project allows users to create, edit documents

1. The document stays in the database for further use, just keep the id or url with you
2. The document reflects live if multiple users try to update the data on the same id document
3. basic writing features are added on using quill

As the link is not working

1. Download all the packages in client and server using npm i
2. start the server/src/index.server.js with node
3. start the client with npm start
